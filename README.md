We are a truffle trading company, and we have a job for you!

No matter how ridiculous the following sound, please listen. Our clients are inhabitants of another dimension of the Earth. Even if you live in it every day, you can't see it or interfere with it.

This dimension is called the truffle-sphere. Many spore clusters grow in it, but they are invisible to the human eye, which we call Ether Truffles. Since the truffle-sphere shares the same spatial and weather conditions as our world, the growth of Ether Truffles also relates to those factors that influence the fungus growth in our world.

Our clients, the inhabitants of the truffle-sphere, rely on those Ether Truffles to sustain their daily lives. However, they cannot collect truffles by themselves. In the past, our clients designed some collecting robots to help them collect truffles. However, something weird has been happening recently. Collecting robots stopped moving and collecting. A global famine is now spreading in the truffle-sphere. If there are no sufficient quantities of Ether Truffles collected, the population of the truffle-sphere will soon die out.

Our company now plans to hire humans to complete the harvesting operation. The business is still exploratory and requires only a license to search and pick Ether Truffles with the relevant equipment. Once the marketplace is created, you can sell them to us on the marketplace.
